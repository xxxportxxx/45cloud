WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000


00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:02.265
They're in.

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:45.878
<i>This will make me happy.</i>

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.802
<i>How much should we cook?</i>

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:51.247
This batch will yield 30 pounds.

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.372
Move, tweak.

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:56.942
Are you fucking kidding me? Don't
be lighting that shit up in here.

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:58.554
Take it outside, Jojo.

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:00.491
All right.

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:03.382
Deal we had was 50
keys by a plane, JT.

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:06.427
Your guy gets held up at Port
Arthur, that is not my problem.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.325
Danny T will appreciate that.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.791
Everything set, Dalton?
Yeah, all good.

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:14.293
Same plane, same pilot,
same price. Good.

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.895
Fuck this half-ass plane.

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:17.396
We have 20 hardcore
motherfuckers

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:19.498
who can drive this
shit to Tucson.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.178
Well, my way is the safe way.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.671
Your call, Danny.

00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:28.619
Look, you're my kid, but
we're doing it Dalton's way.

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:31.844
Everybody, let's start
packing this shit up.

00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:33.512
We're out of here in 30 minutes.
Let's go.

00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:39.853
Let's roll, boys.

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:46.864
Go, go, go.

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:50.039
Go, go, go. AGENT
Get your hands up.

00:03:57.504 --> 00:03:59.945
We need to go. We need to go.

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:02.374
DEA! Show me your hands!

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:03.843
Don't move. Don't move.
Show me your hands!

00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:05.887
Get 'em up! Get on the ground!

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.515
Jesus Christ. Somebody give
me a 20 on my agent inside.

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:10.837
- Don't move.
- All right.

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:14.088
Don't do it! Don't do it!

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:26.641
You were one of us,
you fucking rat!

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:30.536
Move. Move.

00:04:30.537 --> 00:04:31.909
What the fuck was that?

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:40.754
Jojo, let's get the
fuck out of here.

00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:42.185
Drop your weapon!

00:04:46.553 --> 00:04:47.953
Freeze.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:49.497
He's undercover!

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:51.557
Stand down!

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:53.559
Stand the fuck down!

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.433
Put your fucking weapon down!

00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:10.519
Take that, motherfucker!

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:16.949
All units, I got
two on the move.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.085
Dark green muscle car heading
South-east on St. Bernard towards MLK.

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:23.062
Agent in pursuit. I
repeat, agent in pursuit.

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:27.960
What the fuck was that?

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:29.795
Fuck! There's cops all
over the fucking place.

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:31.703
Fuck! Fuck!

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.211
Come on, Dalton.

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:47.824
You wanna play chicken,
motherfucker? Let's do this.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.900
Out of this car, Danny.

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.168
Out of the car!

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.175
You rat, motherfucker!

00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:19.515
Put the gun down.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.248
Drop it, Jojo.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.225
Drop the gun. Drop it!

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:28.220
Ahh!

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.488
Drop the gun.

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:30.861
Stand down! Stand down!

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:34.035
He's DEA! Get him away.

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:35.804
Stand down.

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:37.099
Fuck you.

00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:12.531
You were one of us.

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:15.100
You murdered my son,
you motherfucker.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:18.145
You're dead. Your kids
are fucking dead.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.276
He was down. He was done.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.923
He went for his gun.
That's protocol, Broker.

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:32.418
Broker. Broker!

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:35.623
Don't walk away from me.
Broker!

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.184
Cool hat.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:19.994
Thanks.

00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:36.802
Give it back.

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:38.070
You scared?

00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:39.838
I said, give it back.

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.450
You want it? Come get it.

00:10:43.843 --> 00:10:46.216
What are you gonna do about it?
Cry?

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.280
Go on.

00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:50.154
Cry.

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.085
I asked you twice.

00:10:53.086 --> 00:10:54.321
Twice what, loser?

00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:02.829
I asked twice.

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:11.436
Yeah, if you're gonna take the job,
you might as well do it right.

00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:13.205
There's all kinds of
wood you can get here.

00:11:13.206 --> 00:11:17.109
You got virgin cypress,
you got longleaf pine,

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.477
you got that pressure
treated pine.

00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:19.878
Well, that's my favorite one.

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:21.947
Now, anybody want to use the
cheapest shit they can find,

00:11:21.948 --> 00:11:23.525
might as well buy
the shit from Ikea.

00:11:24.384 --> 00:11:27.119
Look at this. Mites done
ate all through it.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.594
Man!

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:31.957
Wonder why you got to do the
job again every two years.

00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.195
That's some shit. Look at this.
Hello.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.504
I'll be right there.

00:11:42.302 --> 00:11:43.368
Something wrong?

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:44.843
Oh, something at Maddy's school.

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:47.745
You okay to finish? Yeah, man.

00:11:47.974 --> 00:11:50.677
I'm working with you,
not for you, Broker.

00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:53.845
Hey, Broker, don't sweat it.
It's probably nothing.

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:55.787
Yeah, you could be right.

00:12:34.662 --> 00:12:37.022
I hear you, but you need
to stay calm about this.

00:12:37.023 --> 00:12:38.090
Stay calm? I don't feel calm,

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.791
so why the hell
should I stay calm?

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:41.460
No, 'cause it makes no
logical damn sense.

00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:43.895
Now I want this thing
settled, and I mean now.

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:45.030
It's gonna be, honey.

00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:47.199
But getting yourself all wound
up like this ain't helping.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.867
Who's that, huh? That's right.
Just listen to Jim.

00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:50.702
Who's that? You know him? Huh?

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:51.770
I don't know.

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.417
Is that the father of the goddamn
little girl? Are you the father?

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:57.609
Mr. Broker?

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.977
What happened?

00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:02.125
Maddy's fine. She's in the
classroom. Will you come with me?

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:03.987
I want to see my boy.

00:13:05.151 --> 00:13:07.286
- Teddy, baby, you okay?
- Cassie!

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.221
Look at this. Does it hurt?
I know it does.

00:13:09.222 --> 00:13:11.056
Look, there's blood all over
his goddamn new shirt, Jimmy.

00:13:11.057 --> 00:13:12.124
That's why you gotta watch

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:13.225
the sneaky little bitches
on the playground.

00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:14.893
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

00:13:14.894 --> 00:13:16.662
Hey, what, huh? Hey, what?
You wanna say something?

00:13:16.663 --> 00:13:18.563
Hey, hey, hey. You wanna
say something to me?

00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:20.599
Why don't we just let
them leave the building?

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.801
Why is the sheriff here?

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.670
For Cassie Bodine.

00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:27.572
Last time we had a scene with Cassie,
she threatened the principal.

00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:29.446
Their son is a
special needs case.

00:13:29.609 --> 00:13:32.077
By the way, I'm Susan
Hetch, school psychologist.

00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:33.245
Phil Broker.

00:13:33.246 --> 00:13:35.187
Listen, you've got a great girl.

00:13:41.954 --> 00:13:43.462
You all right?

00:13:45.358 --> 00:13:46.969
So, what happened?

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.995
I warned him two times,
like I was supposed to.

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:53.265
The schoolyard monitor said she
saw Maddy hit Teddy pretty hard,

00:13:53.266 --> 00:13:54.766
like she knew what
she was doing.

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:56.301
He started it. He's a bully.

00:13:56.302 --> 00:13:57.602
Maddy, come on. Hey.

00:13:57.603 --> 00:13:59.204
Maybe this is my fault.

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:00.975
I taught her to defend herself.

00:14:02.176 --> 00:14:04.176
Think it's good teaching
your little girl to fight?

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.677
No.

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:07.880
Defend herself though, yeah.

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:13.027
Hey, Maddy, do you mind waiting
in the hall, just for a minute?

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:15.698
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.127
So, Why'd you guys move up here?

00:14:22.128 --> 00:14:23.830
It's a little remote
for most people.

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:26.131
She wanted a horse.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:32.637
Maddy's mother grew
up around here, so

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:35.140
thought it'd be a good
place to start rebuilding.

00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:37.947
Her file says that your
wife died fairly recently.

00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:40.181
Last year? Yeah.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.124
It's been hard on her.

00:14:43.149 --> 00:14:45.590
Her mom was sick for a while.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.293
Anything else?

00:14:55.995 --> 00:14:57.529
Why has he been picking on me?

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.331
Yeah, he picks on you because
he thinks you're different.

00:14:59.332 --> 00:15:00.432
But I'm not different.

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:02.167
Well, from him you are.

00:15:02.168 --> 00:15:04.002
Nothing gets clone about it.

00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:06.671
Except this guy here
gets walking along.

00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:08.673
- Nothing happening there.
- Okay.

00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:10.818
Oh, well, then do it.
Do it! All right.

00:15:10.843 --> 00:15:12.244
Hey, Broker. Hey, Jimmy.

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:13.879
Broker! All right, stand
by the car, baby.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.781
What's wrong? Just stand
by the car, please.

00:15:15.782 --> 00:15:16.882
Don't take any shit, Jimmy.

00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:18.426
Jimmy, back in the
truck, please.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.855
You owe my son a
goddamn apology.

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:26.258
Take it easy, like the
officer said, okay?

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:28.293
Jimmy, back in the
truck, please.

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:30.629
Some sneaky little bitch
cheap shots my son.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.964
Somebody owes us a
goddamn apology.

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:34.099
That's goddamn right.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.768
Don't call her that, please.
Don't call her that.

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.036
Can you get in the
truck, please, honey?

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:39.304
Don't turn your back on me.

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:40.605
Honey, baby, get in the truck.

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.686
- Get him, Jimmy. Get him, Jimmy.
- Hey, hey, hey!

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:45.210
- Come on, take him down, Jimmy.
- Hey.

00:15:45.211 --> 00:15:46.445
Hey, hey, hey.

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:48.455
Arrest him! Keith! Get
off of him. Back off.

00:15:48.748 --> 00:15:50.715
What the fuck are you doing?

00:15:50.716 --> 00:15:52.651
Get this motherfucker out
of here. Sir, move away.

00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:54.719
God damn it, what
are you doing?

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.221
Keith, what the
fuck are you doing?

00:15:56.222 --> 00:15:57.696
Cassie, shut up.

00:15:58.764 --> 00:16:00.325
You're gonna let him
get away with that?

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:01.698
It's okay, baby.
Get in the truck.

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:03.663
It doesn't look okay.
It's okay.

00:16:05.164 --> 00:16:06.565
Get in the truck.

00:16:06.566 --> 00:16:08.400
Go and do something,
Are you okay?

00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:10.706
Breathe, Jimmy. Jesus Christ!

00:16:10.937 --> 00:16:13.881
Yes, mosey on over.

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:15.807
- Am I in trouble here?
- No, no.

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:19.285
I saw what happened.
He was out of line.

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:22.389
You really had to take him
down that hard though?

00:16:22.515 --> 00:16:25.484
Embarrassed a man in front
of his child, Mr. Broker.

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:27.494
It goes both ways, Sheriff.

00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:29.457
She all right?

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:32.757
You all right?

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:35.427
So, you moved into the old
Griffin place awhile back?

00:16:35.428 --> 00:16:37.262
What you doing to keep
busy around here?

00:16:37.263 --> 00:16:39.500
There a reason you're
asking these questions?

00:16:40.132 --> 00:16:42.209
Well, maybe I'm just
being friendly.

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:44.603
Or maybe I'm bored,
or maybe I'm curious,

00:16:44.604 --> 00:16:46.477
or whatever, it doesn't matter.

00:16:46.606 --> 00:16:48.173
It's my right to ask.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.581
Things got out of hand, Sheriff.
That won't happen again.

00:16:56.616 --> 00:16:58.159
Dad.

00:16:58.451 --> 00:17:01.188
There's a bunch of teachers
watching us right now.

00:17:27.813 --> 00:17:29.117
You're a pussy.

00:17:29.916 --> 00:17:34.030
What? I said you are a
motherfucking pussy.

00:17:34.487 --> 00:17:36.030
That's what you are.

00:17:39.158 --> 00:17:41.638
You let him make fools out of all
of us, in front of everybody.

00:17:41.928 --> 00:17:43.828
Now the whole fucking
town is gonna know.

00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:45.196
Look, I lost my...

00:17:45.197 --> 00:17:47.499
You lost your what, Jimmy?
You lost your what?

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.167
I lost my balance.

00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:50.235
You fucking lost your balance.

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:51.703
He spun you, dropped
you on your ass.

00:17:51.704 --> 00:17:53.104
Mom, don't curse.

00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:54.439
Dad tripped just like me.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.607
What's the plan, Jimmy?

00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:57.242
Right now, nothing.

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:59.010
We still got Keith on our tail.

00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:00.554
Fuck Keith!

00:18:02.782 --> 00:18:04.683
How did he buy that new truck?

00:18:04.684 --> 00:18:06.718
That's what I want to know. How
did he buy that new truck?

00:18:06.719 --> 00:18:08.429
Who? Who?

00:18:08.454 --> 00:18:10.099
Fucking who?

00:18:10.723 --> 00:18:13.904
Him! The motherfucker that put
you clown. You forget him?

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:19.269
My God, he put you down so hard.

00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:26.610
I gotta see my brother.

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:30.252
Let's just keep this a
family matter, Cass.

00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:34.288
What do you call him?

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:40.452
Yeah, now you're acting all big.

00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:42.291
Fucking idiot.

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:12.787
Come on now, fire
that fucking shit up.

00:19:17.456 --> 00:19:20.796
Look at you, you
dumb motherfucker!

00:19:23.863 --> 00:19:27.636
Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!

00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:32.543
Afternoon.

00:19:33.139 --> 00:19:35.649
Tweaker birds, cooking
up some shit.

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:39.110
Turn that music off.

00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:41.882
Turn that fucking music off!

00:19:43.616 --> 00:19:44.817
Hey.

00:19:45.384 --> 00:19:46.995
How old are you?

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:48.888
Seventeen.

00:19:51.123 --> 00:19:52.444
All right, go on.
Get out of here.

00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:53.349
Are you coming?

00:19:53.374 --> 00:19:55.592
They ain't coming. Get
the fuck out of here!

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:02.167
As for you guys...

00:20:08.307 --> 00:20:10.180
Fuck!

00:20:10.342 --> 00:20:12.215
Oh, fuck.

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:16.014
My name is Gator Bodine.

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:19.918
Hope I didn't hurt
you too badly, Sir.

00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:22.320
Just wanted you to get a little
taste of what's gonna happen to you

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:24.656
if you continue cooking
this illegal substance

00:20:24.657 --> 00:20:26.803
in my neck of the woods.

00:20:27.493 --> 00:20:30.028
Look, man. We didn't
mean no disrespect.

00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:32.497
This here is just
for us, you know.

00:20:32.498 --> 00:20:34.399
Oh, I don't doubt it.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.807
Just fun, just kids having fun.

00:20:37.203 --> 00:20:39.404
Enjoying life.

00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:41.107
Celebrating.

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:44.342
Well, let me warn you,

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:47.011
I've got a five-gallon can
of gasoline out in my truck

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:50.081
that I will happily pour
down your fucking throats

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:54.492
if I ever catch you cooking and
stinking up my town again.

00:21:01.794 --> 00:21:03.302
God, stop!

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:08.567
Now, listen up.

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:11.680
I don't wanna have to kill
a bunch of little kids.

00:21:12.972 --> 00:21:17.780
You will stand up and run,
in any direction you please.

00:21:18.244 --> 00:21:20.253
Just not this one.

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:22.213
That clear? Yeah.

00:21:22.214 --> 00:21:24.257
All right, now get the
fuck out of here!

00:21:24.383 --> 00:21:25.860
Go!

00:21:25.885 --> 00:21:27.257
Run!

00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:28.688
Run!

00:21:34.994 --> 00:21:37.834
Piece of shit
kindergarten operation.

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:41.468
Fucking kids suck.

00:21:45.237 --> 00:21:47.781
How are the knuckles, bruiser?

00:21:48.107 --> 00:21:50.175
It feels fine now, Dad.
Oh, yeah?

00:21:50.176 --> 00:21:53.111
Watch out, here comes
Maddy Mad-fists. Pow!

00:21:53.112 --> 00:21:54.723
Dad. Really?

00:21:55.114 --> 00:21:56.622
Mmm-hmm. Really?

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:00.030
Come on. All right, listen.

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:03.323
I'm proud you stood
up for yourself.

00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:06.969
You set boundaries
with this kid.

00:22:10.596 --> 00:22:13.367
Sounds like a motorboat.
What, is he snoring?

00:22:18.604 --> 00:22:19.805
Dad?

00:22:19.939 --> 00:22:21.482
Yeah.

00:22:21.674 --> 00:22:23.751
Were you scared today?

00:22:24.844 --> 00:22:26.318
The truth.

00:22:26.645 --> 00:22:28.984
There's nothing wrong with
being a little scared.

00:22:30.516 --> 00:22:32.161
Then why didn't you look scared?

00:22:32.718 --> 00:22:34.261
Lots of practice.

00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:38.062
Night, Luther.

00:22:38.958 --> 00:22:40.124
Dad?

00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:41.326
Yes.

00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:44.229
What do you think of Miss Hetch?

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.941
I'd say she's... I'd
say she's all right.

00:22:46.966 --> 00:22:48.499
You know what I mean. Yes.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.179
I know exactly what you mean.

00:22:50.636 --> 00:22:53.043
Goodnight. Goodnight.

00:23:11.523 --> 00:23:13.202
Shit.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.765
Look, you need to cool way down.

00:23:20.766 --> 00:23:22.166
I need to cool way down?

00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:25.169
You think we're gonna be
disrespected by some son of a bitch?

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.671
Well, I hate to say it,

00:23:26.672 --> 00:23:29.874
but putting your old man on the
ground ain't any big thing.

00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:31.342
When he was talking to Keith,

00:23:31.343 --> 00:23:33.244
I heard him say... What, the
fucking sheriff was there?

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:36.449
I heard him say he was living
at the old Griffin place.

00:23:36.882 --> 00:23:38.082
Fuck.

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:40.092
Can't you go over there
and do some things?

00:23:40.552 --> 00:23:42.387
Do what things? Mess
with their heads,

00:23:42.388 --> 00:23:44.188
like you do everyone else.

00:23:44.189 --> 00:23:45.959
Scare 'em.

00:23:48.961 --> 00:23:50.231
Hey, boss.

00:23:50.462 --> 00:23:52.363
We good for the night?

00:23:52.364 --> 00:23:54.318
I'll talk lo you two in
a minute, all right?

00:23:54.343 --> 00:23:55.343
All right.

00:23:56.302 --> 00:23:58.743
Good seeing you again, Cassie.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.440
What the hell's wrong
with those two?

00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:04.909
Never mind 'em. Fucking
monkeys is what they are.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.680
Hey. Mmm?

00:24:07.713 --> 00:24:09.859
You look a little jumpy.
I know.

00:24:12.217 --> 00:24:14.090
I need something.

00:24:14.486 --> 00:24:16.290
I need a little something

00:24:16.422 --> 00:24:18.659
to stop my stomach
from knotting up.

00:24:24.396 --> 00:24:26.473
You want me to beg?

00:24:30.903 --> 00:24:32.343
No.

00:24:43.415 --> 00:24:44.616
No.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.618
If I can control it, you
can control it, right?

00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:49.526
Yeah.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.294
I'll handle that Broker thing.

00:24:56.295 --> 00:24:57.997
Thank you.

00:25:42.474 --> 00:25:45.710
Planning kids' birthday
parties, it's my specialty.

00:25:45.711 --> 00:25:47.145
Be happy to take
care of it for her.

00:25:47.146 --> 00:25:48.646
Thanks.

00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:50.481
I'm not very good with those
things. Missed half of them.

00:25:50.482 --> 00:25:53.084
Don't worry. I'm on it.
It'll be fun.

00:25:53.085 --> 00:25:54.855
You know, she really
likes you, Susan.

00:25:55.421 --> 00:25:57.862
It's a bit of a
milestone, I'd say.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.391
Do you think you can
talk to her sometime?

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:01.900
Of course.

00:26:02.828 --> 00:26:04.701
Maddy used to talk to
her mom for hours.

00:26:05.664 --> 00:26:08.599
I think she'd like to talk
to a woman more often.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.767
I'd be happy to.

00:26:09.768 --> 00:26:10.868
Thanks.

00:26:10.869 --> 00:26:12.703
One more thing,

00:26:12.704 --> 00:26:15.145
people around here can
do some foolish things.

00:26:15.874 --> 00:26:17.241
Meaning?

00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:21.179
It's a bit like Appalachia,
like feuds, they still exist.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.450
And you're new here.

00:26:22.781 --> 00:26:24.882
So I just think it would
be best for Maddy

00:26:24.883 --> 00:26:26.851
if you would smooth
everything over

00:26:26.852 --> 00:26:28.719
while it's still fresh
in people's minds.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.161
Just two kids
working things out.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:32.857
You can go from two
kids and a fistfight

00:26:32.858 --> 00:26:34.358
to the emergency room real fast.

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:36.402
I didn't know this town
had an emergency room.

00:26:37.229 --> 00:26:38.430
Now you're catching on.

00:26:39.064 --> 00:26:40.398
Look, people talk.

00:26:40.399 --> 00:26:43.603
They decided you're a
question Mark, so.

00:26:45.037 --> 00:26:47.843
Keep it smooth. Check.

00:27:11.096 --> 00:27:14.470
You want something around here?
I don't think so.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.401
Look, what happened, happened.

00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:19.172
We don't want any more trouble.

00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:22.740
See, your kid made the trouble.
Not ours, yours.

00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:24.943
What do we need to do to
make this go away, Jimmy?

00:27:26.979 --> 00:27:28.283
From you?

00:27:32.684 --> 00:27:33.988
I want an apology.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.793
Full apology.

00:27:37.089 --> 00:27:39.123
I want you to
apologize to my wife,

00:27:39.124 --> 00:27:41.192
'cause it's what's
right, and my kid, too.

00:27:41.193 --> 00:27:43.339
He saw the whole damn thing.

00:27:44.429 --> 00:27:46.264
I apologize for what happened.

00:27:46.265 --> 00:27:48.536
To them, too.

00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:54.507
We good now, Jimmy?

00:27:56.942 --> 00:27:58.644
Yeah, all right.

00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:02.417
Go on. You've said enough.

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:29.307
Go ahead and pump
it your own self.

00:28:29.308 --> 00:28:31.249
I'll be with you in a minute.

00:28:35.214 --> 00:28:37.860
God damn, Mama's freezer.

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:54.599
There he is.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.211
Fuck!

00:28:57.002 --> 00:28:59.409
Still ain't got this
piece of shit fixed.

00:29:02.541 --> 00:29:03.879
Hey, neighbor, how you doing?

00:29:07.012 --> 00:29:08.282
Can I get that pump?

00:29:09.715 --> 00:29:11.588
I'm almost done.

00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:16.990
See, I need the goddamn pump
right now. Did you hear me?

00:29:19.524 --> 00:29:21.465
- Can I help y'all out here?
- No.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.794
We don't need your help.

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:25.440
He's done.

00:29:25.964 --> 00:29:27.234
Fill up the truck, Clay.

00:29:33.739 --> 00:29:35.941
That's $12.84, Sir.

00:29:37.042 --> 00:29:38.346
I wasn't done yet.

00:29:40.312 --> 00:29:42.014
I think you are.

00:29:45.083 --> 00:29:48.196
Whatever you're
thinking, rethink it.

00:29:51.256 --> 00:29:54.096
"Rethink it." He wants
me to rethink it.

00:29:55.294 --> 00:29:57.895
You ain't turning that back on.

00:29:57.896 --> 00:29:59.541
Oh, shit.

00:30:06.004 --> 00:30:07.342
You fucked up.

00:30:16.315 --> 00:30:18.290
Why don't we step around
the side of the building

00:30:20.085 --> 00:30:22.959
so I can kick your fucking
ass up over your shoulders?

00:30:49.147 --> 00:30:50.417
They from around here?

00:30:51.183 --> 00:30:52.384
I ain't never seen them.

00:30:56.955 --> 00:30:58.896
Who put you up to this?

00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:02.229
Nobody.

00:31:24.983 --> 00:31:26.526
Bring that over.

00:31:30.055 --> 00:31:31.928
Down the hatch.

00:31:39.998 --> 00:31:41.575
Yeah?

00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:44.372
Fuck.

00:31:44.503 --> 00:31:46.546
How the fuck did that happen?

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:52.153
His fucking kid goes to my nephew's
school! I don't fucking know!

00:31:53.512 --> 00:31:56.056
Yeah, I'll deal with it.
God damn it!

00:32:07.092 --> 00:32:08.965
Dad? Mmm-hmm?

00:32:09.294 --> 00:32:11.303
What happened to your hands?

00:32:11.863 --> 00:32:13.097
Right there?

00:32:13.098 --> 00:32:14.902
Oh, yeah.

00:32:15.567 --> 00:32:18.536
Me and Teedo were trying to pull that
Rusty, old fence out of the ground,

00:32:18.537 --> 00:32:21.274
you know, the one
behind the stable.

00:32:21.807 --> 00:32:23.418
Yeah.

00:32:24.042 --> 00:32:26.085
We won, though.

00:32:46.832 --> 00:32:48.375
Afternoon.

00:32:48.733 --> 00:32:51.004
Mind stepping out for a minute?

00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:55.110
You can stay in there, little
girl, this won't take too long.

00:32:58.777 --> 00:33:00.678
Is there a problem, Sheriff?

00:33:00.679 --> 00:33:05.349
Well, I got a report of an
altercation at the filling station.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.918
You know anything about that?

00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:09.792
Anybody pressing charges?

00:33:10.255 --> 00:33:13.123
No, nobody is
pressing any charges.

00:33:13.124 --> 00:33:15.133
Then there's nothing
worth talking about.

00:33:16.695 --> 00:33:18.195
What are you' son?

00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:21.570
You WITSEC, huh?

00:33:22.267 --> 00:33:25.703
You ex-military,
ex-law enforcement?

00:33:25.704 --> 00:33:27.304
Ex-what?

00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:30.349
Well, if I were
ex-military, Sheriff,

00:33:31.142 --> 00:33:35.051
I'd probably refer to the answer
as "need to know information."

00:33:35.814 --> 00:33:39.154
Maybe some people
don't need to know.

00:33:41.453 --> 00:33:44.065
Here's what you need
to know, Broker.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.166
You have got my attention, son.

00:33:53.732 --> 00:33:55.172
Get that hand looked at.

00:34:05.644 --> 00:34:08.381
You're gonna leave me
behind today, as usual?

00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:11.982
I think so.

00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:14.424
Making new friends at school?

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:17.087
Yeah, I made a lot of friends.

00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:19.723
I've learned some cool
stuff in science class.

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:21.258
I don't believe that.

00:34:21.259 --> 00:34:25.095
Did you know that the trees
along the river, bald cypress,

00:34:25.096 --> 00:34:27.531
they can grow, like, 100 feet.

00:34:27.532 --> 00:34:28.766
That is cool.

00:34:28.767 --> 00:34:31.035
But not as cool as snakes.

00:34:31.036 --> 00:34:32.369
Snakes? Yeah.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:37.174
We've got moccasins'
copperheads, diamondbacks.

00:34:37.175 --> 00:34:39.176
No King cobras, right?

00:34:39.177 --> 00:34:42.046
Dad' no, King cobras are like,
from the far east somewhere.

00:34:42.047 --> 00:34:44.056
That's a relief.

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:52.457
Dad? Yeah?

00:34:53.358 --> 00:34:54.798
Why did we move out here?

00:34:55.026 --> 00:34:57.861
Why? Because there's
no King cobras.

00:34:57.862 --> 00:34:59.530
Come on, look around.

00:34:59.531 --> 00:35:02.439
A beautiful house, horse
trails, river in our backyard.

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:05.341
Seriously, what else
could we ask for?

00:35:06.538 --> 00:35:08.081
Wi-Fi.

00:35:08.607 --> 00:35:09.740
Wi-Fi?

00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:11.648
Yeah, Wi-Fi.

00:35:13.878 --> 00:35:15.523
Anyone home?

00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:21.827
Your door is open.

00:35:22.821 --> 00:35:24.796
Neighbor calling.

00:35:29.227 --> 00:35:30.628
That was a tie.

00:35:30.629 --> 00:35:32.137
OK.

00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:35.675
Maybe. I think you got it.

00:35:38.269 --> 00:35:40.005
Do you know "Grace"?

00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:43.107
She a new friend at school?

00:35:43.108 --> 00:35:45.948
The new vocab word from class.

00:35:47.178 --> 00:35:49.984
"Grace." Yeah,
that's a good one.

00:35:54.953 --> 00:35:56.962
I think Mom had that.

00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:01.994
Yeah, you got a
good memory, Maddy.

00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:04.634
She did.

00:36:05.597 --> 00:36:08.300
The way she dressed, smiled.

00:36:09.034 --> 00:36:11.145
Everything about her.

00:36:20.512 --> 00:36:22.248
I miss Mom.

00:36:24.616 --> 00:36:26.159
Me, too.

00:36:32.524 --> 00:36:36.866
I just... I miss her so
much that my stomach hurts.

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:45.010
And I get this feeling that
she worries about you.

00:36:47.072 --> 00:36:49.752
And that she wants
you to be happy.

00:36:50.475 --> 00:36:52.120
Come here.

00:36:57.515 --> 00:36:59.194
Hey.

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:03.357
If you're here, I'm happy.

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:07.966
Come on, what else could I be?

00:38:06.718 --> 00:38:08.252
Come on, catch up.

00:38:08.253 --> 00:38:10.865
I find myself always
trying to do that.

00:38:27.806 --> 00:38:29.644
Luther!

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:32.349
Luther!

00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:50.999
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

00:38:52.263 --> 00:38:55.535
Easy, boy, easy. Easy.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.392
Dad?

00:39:17.889 --> 00:39:19.329
Dad!

00:39:20.124 --> 00:39:21.692
Have you seen Luther?

00:39:21.693 --> 00:39:23.961
Luther? No, sweetie.

00:39:23.962 --> 00:39:26.296
I don't hear his bell.
I'll go look.

00:39:26.297 --> 00:39:28.398
Hey. Get back inside.

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:30.000
You should be getting
ready for bed.

00:39:30.001 --> 00:39:32.236
Don't worry, I'll find him.
Off you go.

00:39:32.237 --> 00:39:33.438
Okay.

00:39:37.475 --> 00:39:39.810
Dad, you know I can't
sleep without Luther.

00:39:39.811 --> 00:39:42.719
I know, but I need
you to try, okay?

00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:45.682
I'll find him.

00:39:45.683 --> 00:39:47.718
And you'll find Bunny, too?
Yes.

00:39:47.719 --> 00:39:49.421
I'll find them both.

00:39:49.921 --> 00:39:51.191
Hey.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:54.536
It'll be okay. Okay.

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:02.872
Luther. Come here, kitty.
Luther.

00:40:11.175 --> 00:40:12.581
"Phil Broker."

00:40:16.748 --> 00:40:18.393
Motherfucker!

00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:23.825
Nice hair.

00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:31.094
"For a few years now,
biker gang known as"

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:34.264
<i>"the Outcast motorcycle
gang led by Danny Turrie."</i>

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:37.601
No! You're done! You're dead!

00:40:37.602 --> 00:40:39.804
Holy shit!

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:47.244
Broker, Broker, Broker.

00:40:47.245 --> 00:40:49.982
Very nice to meet
you, Agent Broker.

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:54.596
Luther?

00:40:55.586 --> 00:40:57.424
Luther?

00:40:57.588 --> 00:40:59.096
Come on.

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:34.065
Coming through!

00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:35.759
Yeah?

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.095
Hey, I think I got
something big for us.

00:41:38.096 --> 00:41:39.796
Big? Like what?

00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:42.299
Just get over here
as soon as possible.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.267
My shift doesn't end for
another three hours.

00:41:44.268 --> 00:41:47.604
Then I've got to drive from
Shreveport? Gator, shit.

00:41:47.605 --> 00:41:51.875
All right, all right. Just make it
first thing in the morning, okay?

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:53.384
Everything is changing.

00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:48.903
Yeah!

00:42:49.434 --> 00:42:50.704
Remember Jojo?

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:52.669
Jojo Turrie?

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:55.505
Danny T's boy?
Of course, I do.

00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:56.773
The kid was bat shit.

00:42:56.774 --> 00:42:58.146
He was.

00:42:59.077 --> 00:43:02.121
Until he got shot by
the police 47 times.

00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:06.049
Losing your only kid like that.

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.628
I hear Danny T is still
pretty fucked up about it.

00:43:09.687 --> 00:43:11.188
Well, yeah.

00:43:11.189 --> 00:43:15.303
Well, they never did catch whoever
snitched on Jojo and Danny T.

00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:17.527
And?

00:43:17.528 --> 00:43:19.002
'Cause it wasn't just a snitch.

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:22.532
It was a goddamn undercover cop.

00:43:22.533 --> 00:43:24.235
Just read.

00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:32.709
<i>That guy Broker,</i>

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.978
<i>he's the snitch they didn't want
showing up in the courtroom.</i>

00:43:34.979 --> 00:43:36.313
What?

00:43:36.314 --> 00:43:38.715
M.C. Dalton, that's
his snitch name.

00:43:38.716 --> 00:43:41.218
<i>A state narc is living
in Rayville. Shit!</i>

00:43:41.219 --> 00:43:42.552
Relax, relax. Do you have...

00:43:42.553 --> 00:43:45.324
I think he's just living low
here with his daughter.

00:43:46.591 --> 00:43:48.998
Trust me, this is our shot.

00:43:51.295 --> 00:43:52.896
What the hell are you
doing here, Broker?

00:43:52.897 --> 00:43:54.303
Turn that off.

00:43:56.167 --> 00:43:57.812
Hey!

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:01.838
Let's skip the bullshit.
Get right to it.

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:04.841
Some small-time amateur
crap, going back and forth.

00:44:04.842 --> 00:44:06.243
Know anything about it?

00:44:06.244 --> 00:44:07.844
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

00:44:07.845 --> 00:44:09.246
Is this fucking
amusing to you, Klum?

00:44:09.247 --> 00:44:11.324
You think it's fucking funny?

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.251
You got your apology.

00:44:14.252 --> 00:44:16.786
Me and my little girl are
gonna be left in peace.

00:44:16.787 --> 00:44:18.728
Don't escalate this any more.

00:44:19.257 --> 00:44:20.959
And Klum,

00:44:22.426 --> 00:44:24.361
I want my kid's cat back.

00:44:24.362 --> 00:44:25.878
Cat?

00:44:25.903 --> 00:44:27.264
I don't know nothing
about no cat.

00:44:27.265 --> 00:44:28.532
Today.

00:44:28.533 --> 00:44:32.476
No hair out of place,
you understand me?

00:44:35.273 --> 00:44:36.713
Good.

00:44:38.776 --> 00:44:42.179
A lot of things have changed
since you were last here.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:48.618
Check it out, I got glassware,
mantles, generator, exhaust system.

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:51.188
Got it all going on.

00:44:51.189 --> 00:44:52.822
Why the fuck do we need Danny T?

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:55.503
We're gonna give him
that rat fuck narc

00:44:55.893 --> 00:44:59.097
in exchange for
state-wide distribution.

00:45:00.464 --> 00:45:02.799
Yeah, but, Gator, these
guys are fucking bikers.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.201
You can't trust them.

00:45:04.202 --> 00:45:05.335
You're gonna give them this guy,

00:45:05.336 --> 00:45:06.903
they're gonna turn around
and they're gonna kill him.

00:45:06.904 --> 00:45:08.638
And then you got nothing.

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:12.342
Look, this means no more small time
jobs, no more sweating middlemen.

00:45:12.343 --> 00:45:14.682
All we do is cook and get paid.

00:45:15.346 --> 00:45:16.980
It's never that easy.

00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:21.318
All you have to do is
learn a few lines,

00:45:21.319 --> 00:45:23.260
go and talk to Danny T's lawyer.

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:25.822
Like hell I am.

00:45:25.823 --> 00:45:29.192
You use them. Coming
back all humble.

00:45:29.193 --> 00:45:31.494
You're not asking for money.

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:35.198
You're giving Danny this
guy as a gift, as a favor.

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:38.068
Gator, that guy
is a fucking pig.

00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:40.545
Shh! Just trust me.

00:45:43.908 --> 00:45:47.146
You're gonna get the
negotiation of your life.

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.221
Ready for the big day tomorrow?

00:45:58.222 --> 00:45:59.889
It's just a birthday.

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:03.693
Hey, come on, it's the 10th
birthday. It's a special one.

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:05.339
I guess.

00:46:06.897 --> 00:46:08.735
Hey, look what I found
jumping around.

00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:12.943
Jumping around? Yeah,
jumping around.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.414
Thanks.

00:46:18.242 --> 00:46:19.785
It's nice.

00:46:20.111 --> 00:46:21.878
I know it's not as
good as the original,

00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:25.315
but I thought she might fill
in until we find Bunny.

00:46:25.316 --> 00:46:27.086
Yep.

00:46:31.122 --> 00:46:32.589
You know, I was thinking,

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:34.861
you should have a birthday
party with your class.

00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:37.138
Can Miss Hetch come?

00:46:37.395 --> 00:46:39.329
She's the one who planned it.

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:41.168
My idea, of course.

00:46:41.766 --> 00:46:43.266
Thanks, Dad.

00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:44.502
Yep.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.323
Sheryl. Sheryl Mott.

00:47:06.324 --> 00:47:08.825
Surprise, surprise, surprise.

00:47:08.826 --> 00:47:12.530
You're not a hard man to find,
Werksey, old habits and all.

00:47:13.631 --> 00:47:15.970
How are you doing, Sheryl?

00:47:17.268 --> 00:47:18.970
What's up, kid?

00:47:19.437 --> 00:47:21.173
I want you to look at something.

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:23.712
Like what?

00:47:24.375 --> 00:47:28.311
You got a new gang tattoo
that you want to show me?

00:47:28.312 --> 00:47:31.114
It's a little bit more
important than that.

00:47:31.115 --> 00:47:34.023
It's a gift for Danny T.

00:47:45.563 --> 00:47:47.401
You got 10 minutes.

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:55.042
"A gift," she says.

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.856
This guy killed my fucking kid.

00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:08.855
Please tell me you know
where this motherfucker is.

00:48:11.822 --> 00:48:13.923
Guess what? Time to go.

00:48:13.924 --> 00:48:15.658
She does.

00:48:15.659 --> 00:48:16.826
Hey, you can finish it tonight.

00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:18.131
Okay.

00:48:19.497 --> 00:48:21.040
Take care of this for me.

00:48:37.548 --> 00:48:39.091
Miss Klum?

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:43.024
What are you going to do now,
Broker? What do you want to say?

00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:51.932
Wanna come to my
party this weekend?

00:48:55.099 --> 00:48:58.610
What, Teddy? She's talking to
you, hon, not me. Come on.

00:48:59.537 --> 00:49:02.081
I guess. Yeah.

00:49:06.477 --> 00:49:08.748
Cool. Come on, let's go.

00:49:09.246 --> 00:49:11.016
All right. Go on.

00:49:12.716 --> 00:49:15.658
Teddy got some blood on his
shirt. Are you replacing it?

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.821
Yeah, I'm replacing it.

00:49:17.822 --> 00:49:19.592
All right. I guess
that does it.

00:49:22.493 --> 00:49:24.673
See you around, Miss Klum.

00:49:34.405 --> 00:49:36.141
So, I heard something
interesting.

00:49:37.441 --> 00:49:40.610
Yeah? Something tells me you're
gonna tell me what that is.

00:49:40.611 --> 00:49:44.347
Just that Jimmy Klum got his
ass whopped. So did his kid.

00:49:44.348 --> 00:49:46.082
Fascinating.

00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:47.584
Where did you hear that?

00:49:47.585 --> 00:49:50.920
Well, you shoot enough pool,
drink enough beer in town,

00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:52.641
you hear a little bit
of everything, Broker.

00:49:53.424 --> 00:49:56.593
By the way, that's old news.
We shook and made up.

00:49:56.594 --> 00:49:57.760
Is that what you think?

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:58.862
Yeah.

00:49:58.863 --> 00:50:00.163
I got some new news for you.

00:50:00.164 --> 00:50:02.139
People around here don't
shake and make up.

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:05.368
It never goes away that easy.

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:07.674
It's old-school in the
feuding sense around here.

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:11.341
Hey, someone broke into our
house. Is that old-school?

00:50:11.342 --> 00:50:13.443
There it is, that's
called country payback.

00:50:13.444 --> 00:50:15.311
Somebody's just trying to scare
your ass out of here, is all.

00:50:15.312 --> 00:50:16.446
You'll be all right.

00:50:16.447 --> 00:50:17.514
Jimmy Klum, you mean?

00:50:17.515 --> 00:50:19.682
Fuck, no. Jimmy
Klum is a bitch.

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:21.784
Listen, I know
everybody around here,

00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:24.693
and Jimmy Klum's bitch ass
ain't breaking into shit.

00:50:25.356 --> 00:50:27.891
Now, his wife's brother is
a whole different story.

00:50:27.892 --> 00:50:29.459
Who's his wife's brother?

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:31.961
They call him Gator for
some dumb-ass reason.

00:50:31.962 --> 00:50:34.631
Lives down by the
Rayville watershed.

00:50:34.632 --> 00:50:37.534
Fronts as a boat mechanic,
can't fix shit.

00:50:37.535 --> 00:50:39.408
But the word is he's
cooking up that meth.

00:50:42.306 --> 00:50:45.542
Hey, if I was you, I'd be real
careful around him, Broker.

00:50:45.543 --> 00:50:47.780
He ain't true, you hear me?

00:50:51.382 --> 00:50:54.217
The sheriff know about him?

00:50:54.218 --> 00:50:55.985
Know about him?

00:50:55.986 --> 00:50:57.987
Man, him and Sheriff Keith
got it all figured out.

00:50:57.988 --> 00:51:00.557
You see, Gator
snitches for Keith,

00:51:00.558 --> 00:51:03.026
throws him all the small
fish, makes his job easy.

00:51:03.027 --> 00:51:06.140
In turn, Sheriff looks the other
direction whenever Gator wants to cook.

00:51:06.664 --> 00:51:08.366
Some bullshit.

00:51:09.767 --> 00:51:11.668
Yeah, thanks for the
history lesson.

00:51:11.669 --> 00:51:13.202
Listen, I grew up
around these rednecks,

00:51:13.203 --> 00:51:16.384
and I think you ought to know
who you're fucking with.

00:51:17.708 --> 00:51:20.043
And in case you
got any interest,

00:51:20.044 --> 00:51:23.987
Gator eats breakfast nearly every
day at Lions café, just like me.

00:51:24.348 --> 00:51:26.015
Now, he don't look
like much or nothing,

00:51:26.016 --> 00:51:27.752
but you remember
what I told you,

00:51:28.185 --> 00:51:29.762
he ain't true.

00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:33.223
Crazy, waiting to happen.

00:51:39.029 --> 00:51:40.430
Hey, where are you?

00:51:40.431 --> 00:51:44.033
They set the meet at this fucking
crayfish shack off Creek Road.

00:51:44.034 --> 00:51:45.935
You know I'm allergic
to this shit, right?

00:51:45.936 --> 00:51:48.304
Just get it done,
all right, Sheryl?

00:51:48.305 --> 00:51:51.040
The guy they're
sending, Cyrus Hanks.

00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:55.144
<i>Are you fucking kidding me? I know
him. He's a fucking animal, Gator.</i>

00:51:55.145 --> 00:51:57.380
He's a fucking
Stone-cold killer.

00:51:57.381 --> 00:52:00.585
Look, don't worry about any
of that. Just make it happen.

00:53:05.616 --> 00:53:07.557
Look at you.

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:11.220
Nice place, Cyrus.

00:53:11.221 --> 00:53:13.856
Yeah, well, let's just say I'm
comfortable around fat people.

00:53:13.857 --> 00:53:15.958
They eat the way
gamblers play the slots,

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:18.061
they're fucking oblivious
to everything around them.

00:53:18.062 --> 00:53:19.570
Plus, I love these
fucking things.

00:53:19.963 --> 00:53:21.364
Are you hungry?

00:53:21.365 --> 00:53:22.799
No, I'm fine.

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.503
Sweetheart, black coffee
with a little honey.

00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:30.673
So, what's it going to take

00:53:30.674 --> 00:53:32.842
to find this rat fuck? You
know where he is, yeah?

00:53:32.843 --> 00:53:34.711
Him and his kid.

00:53:34.712 --> 00:53:39.224
And to get him, you
want what, exactly?

00:53:41.518 --> 00:53:44.320
I don't want anything
for the narc.

00:53:44.321 --> 00:53:47.525
He's a gift. Oh, he's a gift?
He's a gift.

00:53:48.392 --> 00:53:51.038
Since when does a meth
whore give away gifts?

00:53:53.697 --> 00:53:55.498
I've spent the last
couple of years

00:53:55.499 --> 00:53:57.033
putting together the
right equipment,

00:53:57.034 --> 00:53:59.769
perfect partner,
perfect location.

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:02.438
All we need is distribution, that's
the main thing we're after...

00:54:03.874 --> 00:54:06.542
You got me fucking
fooled, Sheryl.

00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:09.545
'Cause underneath this
beautiful tweaker body,

00:54:09.546 --> 00:54:10.884
you're a fucking genius.

00:54:14.051 --> 00:54:15.559
Where's the narc?

00:54:16.186 --> 00:54:17.763
Do we have a deal?

00:54:18.756 --> 00:54:20.356
Where is the narc?

00:54:20.357 --> 00:54:22.798
Do we have a deal, Cyrus?

00:54:29.066 --> 00:54:30.600
Come over here.

00:54:30.601 --> 00:54:33.236
You got five seconds before I drill
your fucking skull into this table

00:54:33.237 --> 00:54:34.937
and then into the floor,
you understand me?

00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:36.372
Don't you fuck with me, Sheryl.

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:37.813
All right.

00:54:39.543 --> 00:54:41.620
Where is the fucking narc?

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.025
Bye!

00:54:45.048 --> 00:54:46.283
Bye.

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.066
Hi.

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:35.141
What are you doing?

00:55:37.768 --> 00:55:39.101
Cleaning.

00:55:39.102 --> 00:55:40.838
Cleaning? Yeah.

00:55:41.371 --> 00:55:42.811
It's filthy in there.

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.775
Well, I'm glad you noticed.

00:55:45.776 --> 00:55:47.080
What are you doing here?

00:55:49.346 --> 00:55:52.652
I came to tell you that I dealt
with Broker, the girl's father.

00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:54.450
I want you to stay
away from him.

00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:56.062
Hey, you got something for me?

00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:58.621
Cassie, I'm trying to
tell you something.

00:55:58.622 --> 00:56:01.393
Do not go near Broker anymore.

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.460
Got it.

00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:05.833
Okay.

00:56:06.797 --> 00:56:09.799
Well, I'm not holding, so I'm
sorry, I can't help you.

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.467
You're not holding?

00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:12.669
Uh-huh.

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:15.071
Well, I think that's
fucking bullshit.

00:56:15.072 --> 00:56:16.639
Cassie, why don't you
just clean yourself up?

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:17.673
That's fucking bullshit!

00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:19.976
Take a fucking shower. Then what
the fuck are you doing here?

00:56:19.977 --> 00:56:21.143
Eat a sandwich or something.

00:56:21.144 --> 00:56:23.379
You take a fucking shower,
Gator, look at you!

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.181
Cassie, just pull
yourself together.

00:56:25.182 --> 00:56:26.816
I'm sick of this shit.
Hey, hey, hey.

00:56:26.817 --> 00:56:29.151
Shh! Teddy is sleeping.

00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:30.887
You wake him up,
it's gonna be...

00:56:30.888 --> 00:56:32.588
Don't worry.

00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:34.700
I'm not gonna make any
noise, I'm leaving.

00:56:36.159 --> 00:56:38.396
No more. I'm done.

00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:42.267
No more, Cassie.

00:56:46.503 --> 00:56:48.046
Yo, Gator.

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:53.982
How is it hanging, man?

00:56:54.878 --> 00:56:56.284
Why?

00:56:57.014 --> 00:57:00.457
Listen, man, I need a favor.

00:57:01.184 --> 00:57:02.795
A favor?

00:57:03.854 --> 00:57:07.223
Look, Jimmy, you know that I already
keep your garbage business going.

00:57:07.224 --> 00:57:10.462
Man, I need you to stop
giving that shit to my wife.

00:57:11.128 --> 00:57:14.468
All right? Look at her, man.
She's falling to pieces.

00:57:16.533 --> 00:57:19.737
Maybe you should do a better
job taking care of her.

00:57:29.246 --> 00:57:31.147
Yeah. You sleeping?

00:57:31.148 --> 00:57:32.648
Like a baby.

00:57:32.649 --> 00:57:33.783
What have you got?

00:57:33.784 --> 00:57:37.420
<i>Gator Bodine. I sniffed around like
you asked. A couple of arrests.</i>

00:57:37.421 --> 00:57:39.259
No convictions.
You want details?

00:57:40.324 --> 00:57:42.058
No, don't bother.

00:57:42.059 --> 00:57:43.659
<i>But there is
something, Broker.</i>

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:47.129
Sheryl Marie Mott, ex-biker
groupie from Shreveport.

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:50.566
<i>Busted twice for smuggling
dope into Angola.</i>

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:54.003
One of those times was to
your old pal, Danny T.

00:57:54.004 --> 00:57:58.448
<i>All of a sudden, Danny T's skank
is hanging out in Rayville.</i>

00:57:58.942 --> 00:58:00.621
Really?

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:03.346
Send me a picture, would you?

00:58:03.347 --> 00:58:06.515
Yeah, first thing at my desk,
I'll email you Mott's file.

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:08.627
Thanks, man.

00:58:45.956 --> 00:58:47.999
<i>So, this guy Cyrus,</i>

00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:49.792
you know him?

00:58:49.793 --> 00:58:51.193
Yeah, I know him.

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:53.195
Mmm-hmm. Did you fuck him?

00:58:56.867 --> 00:58:58.068
Ugh.

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:02.049
Oh, shit.

00:59:07.511 --> 00:59:08.917
Fuck!

00:59:11.648 --> 00:59:13.521
This should be interesting.

00:59:14.251 --> 00:59:16.931
We've never been properly
introduced, you and me.

00:59:18.609 --> 00:59:20.089
Is that what this is,
an introduction?

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:21.490
Yeah, that's right.

00:59:21.491 --> 00:59:23.159
Well, I won't ask your name.

00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:26.432
I personally believe your reputation
is the most important thing.

00:59:27.164 --> 00:59:29.198
To some people. Yeah.

00:59:29.199 --> 00:59:30.933
Maybe it should be for you, too.

00:59:30.934 --> 00:59:32.735
You've worked up a pretty
bad rep around here,

00:59:32.736 --> 00:59:35.438
beating up that poor kids
father in front of him.

00:59:35.439 --> 00:59:37.440
It pissed off some
of the locals.

00:59:37.441 --> 00:59:41.410
And his daughter beat up Jimmy's
kid. Can you believe that?

00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:45.681
Now, what kind of parent would teach
a kid to do something like that?

00:59:45.682 --> 00:59:48.385
Look, I don't want
any more problems.

00:59:48.752 --> 00:59:50.295
Okay.

00:59:52.655 --> 00:59:54.256
Anything else you're
thinking hard about?

00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:56.232
'Cause I can smell
the wood burning.

00:59:56.426 --> 00:59:59.300
If someone has an issue
with me, keep it there.

00:59:59.863 --> 01:00:01.397
I don't want my kid involved.

01:00:01.398 --> 01:00:03.009
Involved?

01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:05.938
I'm a little lost.

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:10.646
Well, let's get you found.

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:12.851
See the house,

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:17.046
the house where we're living,

01:00:17.047 --> 01:00:21.457
the house that was broken
into by some pathetic coward

01:00:22.419 --> 01:00:27.090
who stole a little girl's toys,
the cat, slashed a tire.

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:30.260
See, that's my fucking house.

01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:36.138
Anyone who comes around again
will find me standing in it.

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:38.937
Okay.

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:48.615
Well, I think you're reaching.

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:52.123
Just connecting dots
that are not there.

01:00:53.617 --> 01:00:55.797
You're on notice, Bodine.

01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:01.590
Hey, you should tell your
little girl to be brave.

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:04.670
She's got nothing to worry about
with such a tough daddy around.

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:16.139
Nice meeting you.

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:20.682
Finish your breakfast.

01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:36.358
What the fuck were
you doin', Gator?

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:38.163
Fucker is making it personal.

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:39.833
Yeah, well, we're on.

01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:43.174
It's happening tonight.

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:20.552
Luther?

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.058
Hello, there.

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:28.724
Hey, boy.

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:31.400
Put the kitty down.

01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:32.895
Get up really slow.

01:05:46.643 --> 01:05:47.913
Luther?

01:05:50.213 --> 01:05:51.585
Luther?

01:05:54.384 --> 01:05:56.495
Got you. Hey, Broker.

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:12.209
My old fucking Broker.

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:15.782
How you doing, man?

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:18.041
Can you hear me?

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:19.608
Huh?

01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:21.015
You in there?

01:06:24.914 --> 01:06:27.025
Do you hear me? Do
you hear me now?

01:06:31.287 --> 01:06:32.864
Bet you do.

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:37.396
That's the tricky thing with this
rebar, especially the nine gauge.

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:40.596
You swing it too hard, too fast,

01:06:40.597 --> 01:06:43.243
just takes your whole
fucking head off, man.

01:06:44.701 --> 01:06:46.301
It's a very delicate operation.

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:48.311
Hey, you did all
right, though, Lew.

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:52.315
Gator'd be pissed if we did
something really fucking stupid.

01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:56.984
He must be pissed at
you two quite a lot.

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:02.359
That's funny. You're
a funny guy, Broker.

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:04.321
You're a really
funny fucking guy.

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.222
You smart-ass motherfucker.

01:07:07.223 --> 01:07:08.663
Fucking wise-ass.

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:11.565
How do you like that, huh?

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:16.999
Everybody had you figured
for a cop, Broker.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.568
You walk like a cop,
you fight like a cop,

01:07:19.569 --> 01:07:22.181
you even smell like
a fucking cop.

01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:28.078
Come on.

01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:32.981
Hey, man, Gator'll be here soon.
That's it...

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:36.561
I don't give a shit! I'm calling
the shots! You hear me?

01:07:36.586 --> 01:07:38.288
Hey! Can you hear me?

01:07:38.488 --> 01:07:40.361
Who's watching your
fucking kid, huh?

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:42.468
Who's watching your kid?

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:45.531
Your girlfriend?

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:47.299
She got a babysitter?

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:51.066
Or is she at home
all by herself,

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:55.880
just waiting on you to
come tuck her sorry-ass in

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:58.642
and read her a bedtime story?

01:08:02.612 --> 01:08:03.984
What the fuck!

01:08:05.682 --> 01:08:06.952
You're dead!

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:14.727
Motherfucker!

01:08:46.623 --> 01:08:50.930
When I get home, I am gonna
tell my girl a bedtime story.

01:08:51.628 --> 01:08:53.273
This is how it ends.

01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:21.857
Just tell me, why are we going?
Why?

01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:24.793
I owe you an apology, I know, but we
don't have time to get into that.

01:09:24.794 --> 01:09:26.161
What about school?

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.929
We'll send for your records
in the morning. It's fine.

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:31.033
Send for them? No,
why are we going?

01:09:31.034 --> 01:09:32.634
What's wrong? Nothing's wrong.

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:34.603
They need me back in the city.
It's new business.

01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:36.204
I need to review a case. No!

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:38.681
You said Mom wanted
us to live here.

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:41.543
That's what you said, Dad.
Remember? Yeah, I did. I did.

01:09:41.544 --> 01:09:43.985
Things changed, darling.
Things changed.

01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:46.319
I'm sorry, Maddy.

01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:48.818
I'm sorry.

01:09:49.886 --> 01:09:51.360
You're a liar.

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:07.069
Gator.

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:08.408
You must be Cyrus.

01:10:09.318 --> 01:10:10.639
Sheryl's told me
a lot about you.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.012
Has she?

01:10:12.175 --> 01:10:13.752
That is sweet.

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:17.179
Where is the fuck-up?

01:10:18.481 --> 01:10:21.316
He's about three Miles
South of Route 12.

01:10:21.317 --> 01:10:23.019
Rubber plantation.

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:26.321
I can draw you a map, trail,
even the inside of the house.

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:29.366
No, I don't need a fucking map.
We ain't driving, Gator.

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:32.362
Hey, check this one out.

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:35.700
What the fuck is this?

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:38.500
This many people here,
this a fucking party?

01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:41.545
I don't fucking know. Motherfucker
just showed up with all of them.

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:11.272
<i>You ready to show
us the way, Gator?</i>

01:11:11.567 --> 01:11:13.508
No, I'm not going.

01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:15.036
Come again?

01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:16.905
Look, the first person they're
gonna be looking for is me,

01:11:16.906 --> 01:11:18.440
so I'm not gonna be
anywhere near the site.

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:19.745
I'm gonna be in a public place.

01:11:22.245 --> 01:11:24.925
Guess you don't get to see me
shoot the rat tuck in the mouth.

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:26.616
Guess not.

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:28.586
What about the kid?

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:33.089
It's one-stop shopping,
right, Gator?

01:11:34.657 --> 01:11:35.924
That's right.

01:11:35.925 --> 01:11:37.433
No loose ends.

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:41.897
She's coming with me.

01:11:41.898 --> 01:11:43.131
No, that's not the deal.

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:45.972
No, she's gonna show us the way.
I'll bring her back.

01:11:46.736 --> 01:11:48.006
Be back.

01:11:58.014 --> 01:12:00.081
Listen, I can only hold
them about a week.

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:01.989
Thanks, Teedo,
you're a big help.

01:12:02.952 --> 01:12:04.790
Is there anything you
need to tell me?

01:12:05.855 --> 01:12:08.160
Yeah, there is, but not now.
I got a lot of heat.

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:13.029
All right, then, let me
go load up these nags.

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:43.291
Howdy, Sheriff. Hey, Gator.

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:45.193
How you doing? All right.

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:46.361
Keeping busy, I hope.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:47.495
Yeah.

01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:48.766
That's good.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:52.671
Just made a big sale, so I
thought we'd celebrate.

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:54.847
Congratulations.

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:56.574
Thank you.

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.518
<i>Well, I got a date
with a pool table.</i>

01:13:02.912 --> 01:13:04.179
So I'll be seeing you.

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:05.518
All right.

01:13:05.681 --> 01:13:06.982
Thanks for the whiskey.

01:13:06.983 --> 01:13:08.250
Of course.

01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:09.584
You keep out of trouble, now.

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:10.957
Yes, Sir.

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:45.253
Twenty minutes.

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:48.690
Don't even think about not
being here, you understand me?

01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:50.928
Yeah. Go call your boyfriend.

01:13:51.527 --> 01:13:52.797
Hey!

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:27.056
Motherfucker! Come
on, you fuck!

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:13.872
Where the fuck is he?

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:15.871
Fuck.

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:33.825
Maddy!

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:36.333
Go, go, go.

01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:37.559
Maddy!

01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:41.239
Dad, what was that? Shh!

01:16:41.864 --> 01:16:43.364
Dad, what was that?

01:16:43.365 --> 01:16:44.635
Go.

01:16:52.374 --> 01:16:54.247
I need you to stay down
here, okay, Maddy?

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:55.919
Dial 911.

01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:58.313
Tell them who you
are, where you are.

01:16:58.314 --> 01:17:01.449
Tell them there's a man with a gun
trying to get into the house, okay?

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.856
Go.

01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:43.125
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

01:18:01.443 --> 01:18:02.678
Go.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:25.837
Hey!

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:53.796
No!

01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:59.444
She's getting away!

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:03.542
Maddy!

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:19.354
Hey.

01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:21.398
Gator, man, shit's
gone wrong out here.

01:19:22.151 --> 01:19:23.591
What do you mean
"shit's gone wrong"?

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:26.227
There's too many gunshots
all over the fucking place.

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:29.340
Whoa, whoa, Sheryl, just slow
down. Tell me what's happening.

01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:31.699
Fuck this noise, man. I'm out.

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.801
Just stay there and tell
me what's happening!

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:49.651
Ahh!

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:29.861
Maddy, run! Run!

01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:33.868
Help! Help! Help!

01:20:35.097 --> 01:20:36.331
Help!

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:38.266
Help, please! Help me, please!
Hey, you okay?

01:20:38.267 --> 01:20:39.537
Please help!

01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:45.373
There's a man, and he's
hurting my dad back at our...

01:20:45.374 --> 01:20:46.874
Okay, okay, listen to me.

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:50.211
Listen. These guys, they don't
give a shit about you, all right?

01:20:50.212 --> 01:20:52.483
They're gonna kill you.
Do you understand?

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:02.123
You got to come with me, okay?

01:21:02.124 --> 01:21:04.167
You have to come with me!
Come on.

01:21:09.631 --> 01:21:11.572
Fucking pussy!

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:16.073
Not okay! Dad! No! Listen!

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:40.364
Fuck!

01:21:43.332 --> 01:21:44.636
Let me go!

01:21:45.167 --> 01:21:46.401
Let go of me!

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:47.668
Maddy!

01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:48.836
No, let me go! Dad!

01:21:48.837 --> 01:21:51.608
Maddy! Maddy!

01:21:52.608 --> 01:21:53.946
Come on.

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:57.215
Shit.

01:21:57.613 --> 01:21:58.883
Maddy!

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:05.722
Help, please! Dad!

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:09.326
Dad, help!

01:22:16.799 --> 01:22:18.239
Broker?

01:22:18.367 --> 01:22:19.400
What the hell's going on?

01:22:19.401 --> 01:22:20.602
They hit the house.

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:22.103
They took my girl.

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:23.638
By boat. Headed South
towards Blue Cove.

01:22:23.639 --> 01:22:24.806
What do you mean
"hit the house"?

01:22:24.807 --> 01:22:26.918
An ambush. Five, six men.
All armed.

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:28.409
Tried to kill us.

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:30.050
She's on the river? You
know who took her?

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:39.124
Broker? Broker!

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:41.964
Need a medic!

01:22:46.061 --> 01:22:49.465
Dispatch, I got a...
You'll be okay, Teedo.

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:52.400
Fucking rednecks.

01:22:52.401 --> 01:22:55.236
Sheriff, get on the radio. It's
Broker's daughter on dispatch.

01:22:55.237 --> 01:22:57.004
Broker, your daughter's
on the radio.

01:22:57.005 --> 01:22:58.809
Get compression on this wound.

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:00.641
<i>Maddy, go ahead.</i>

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:02.009
Maddy, tell me you're okay.

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:06.080
Dad? Dad, Dad, please get me
out of here, Daddy. Please?

01:23:06.081 --> 01:23:08.082
Don't worry, baby. Trust me.
I'm coming.

01:23:08.083 --> 01:23:09.984
First, you need to
tell me who took you.

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:13.187
I don't know. Just some
lady with black hair.

01:23:13.188 --> 01:23:15.732
Okay, baby. Here's
what we're gonna do.

01:23:15.757 --> 01:23:17.758
When they take you out, you
need to hide the phone.

01:23:17.759 --> 01:23:18.280
<i>Okay.</i>

01:23:18.305 --> 01:23:20.361
Look for something. A
landmark, anything.

01:23:20.362 --> 01:23:22.163
Okay. Okay.

01:23:22.164 --> 01:23:25.736
<i>Dad... Dad...</i> Maddy.

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:27.471
Maddy?

01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:29.308
Fuck!

01:23:29.638 --> 01:23:33.508
Dispatch, listen here, I need you
to check back every 30 seconds.

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:35.476
No need to, Sheriff.
Track my cell.

01:23:35.477 --> 01:23:37.345
<i>Get a state chopper.
You'll get there faster.</i>

01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:39.480
<i>Got a better idea,
track his cell.</i>

01:23:39.481 --> 01:23:41.048
<i>Let's get the
troopers in on this.</i>

01:23:41.049 --> 01:23:43.851
<i>I need a bear in the air, and every
road within 10 Miles shut down.</i>

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:45.219
Go for 25, work your way in.

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:47.455
<i>25-mile radius.
Work our way in.</i>

01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:49.123
Tell them they're
looking for a 20-foot

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:50.691
Boston Whaler, solo
female driver,

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:51.859
and a center console.

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:54.295
20-foot Boston Whaler, solo
female driver, center console.

01:23:54.296 --> 01:23:57.465
Now, these men that attacked
your house, where are they now?

01:23:57.466 --> 01:23:59.873
They're right there.
How do you know?

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:02.078
Trust me. I know.

01:24:05.307 --> 01:24:07.919
Sheryl, answer your
fucking phone!

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:12.624
Just meet me at the fucking
shop! What the fuck's going on?

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:15.088
Give me the phone.

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.464
Quiet down, now.

01:24:27.829 --> 01:24:29.096
<i>Daddy?</i> Maddy.

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:32.567
Daddy, we're stopping. I'm
really scared. Please hurry.

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:35.146
<i>I see two big fans.</i>

01:24:35.837 --> 01:24:37.812
And we've stopped in a barn.

01:24:44.279 --> 01:24:45.617
Broker!

01:24:45.781 --> 01:24:48.154
Broker, you need
to tell us, now.

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:56.094
Okay.

01:24:59.061 --> 01:25:02.597
Come on. It's okay. It's okay.
Just give me your hand.

01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:03.864
Go away!

01:25:03.865 --> 01:25:05.237
Fuck!

01:25:05.867 --> 01:25:07.234
God!

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:08.914
Fuck!

01:25:11.239 --> 01:25:13.040
Pick up, baby.

01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:15.585
Come on. Come on, Maddy.

01:25:25.554 --> 01:25:27.529
Sheryl, I've been calling you.
What the fuck?

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:30.625
What the fuck happened?

01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:32.293
Everything fucking happened.

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:33.961
What the fuck does that mean?

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:35.563
Where's Cyrus?
Where's everyone?

01:25:35.564 --> 01:25:37.539
I don't fucking know.

01:25:37.833 --> 01:25:39.133
You left them there?

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:40.544
I got the kid.

01:25:40.569 --> 01:25:42.339
What? I have the kid.

01:25:43.005 --> 01:25:44.650
The kid is here.

01:25:46.908 --> 01:25:48.553
You brought her here?

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:53.956
You brought the kid here?

01:25:56.918 --> 01:25:59.655
Are you retarded, Sheryl?

01:25:59.755 --> 01:26:00.956
Don't!

01:26:01.423 --> 01:26:03.090
Don't, Gator!

01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:04.861
Don't what, bitch?

01:26:05.193 --> 01:26:06.565
What the fuck, Gator?

01:26:06.695 --> 01:26:08.129
It's over. Come
on, this is over.

01:26:08.130 --> 01:26:09.497
You brought the
fucking kid here.

01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:10.798
You fucked this up!

01:26:10.799 --> 01:26:12.033
This is not what you do, man!

01:26:12.034 --> 01:26:13.768
You fucking brought
a witness here?

01:26:13.769 --> 01:26:15.436
You do not kill a kid, Gator.

01:26:15.437 --> 01:26:18.039
The only fucking chance
we had, you fucked up!

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:20.007
You brought fucking
Cyrus into this!

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:21.609
Why did you bring the kid here?

01:26:21.610 --> 01:26:23.544
Why the fuck did you bring
her here? Gator. Gator.

01:26:23.545 --> 01:26:25.446
Get your fucking hands off me!

01:26:25.447 --> 01:26:28.093
You brought a fucking
witness here, huh?

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.621
All right. Damn it.

01:26:33.622 --> 01:26:36.325
Just shut the fuck up
and keep her quiet.

01:26:36.525 --> 01:26:38.227
Can you do that?

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:43.998
What y'all doing here?

01:26:43.999 --> 01:26:45.332
Did you hear about the shooting?

01:26:45.333 --> 01:26:46.773
No, what shooting?

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:48.340
Up at the old Griffin place?

01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:51.806
No, I didn't hear about it. No.
You didn't hear about it?

01:26:51.807 --> 01:26:54.308
Word is people are dead
and a child's missing.

01:26:54.309 --> 01:26:55.643
No shit.

01:26:55.644 --> 01:26:58.017
Well, no shooting going on here.

01:26:58.313 --> 01:27:02.086
So maybe y'all better go home. Hey,
Jimmy, you gonna take her home?

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:04.085
Come on. Come on.

01:27:04.086 --> 01:27:05.853
Tell me you didn't have
anything to do with it.

01:27:05.854 --> 01:27:07.688
I didn't have anything
to do with it.

01:27:07.689 --> 01:27:10.224
Now, maybe you're a little high right
now. You're not thinking straight.

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:11.892
But it's time to go home, okay?

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:13.766
Jimmy! Cassie,
come on, let's go.

01:27:14.329 --> 01:27:16.873
We live here, too. You
know what I mean?

01:27:17.433 --> 01:27:18.833
Shit, I got to get
you out of here.

01:27:18.834 --> 01:27:20.000
Let go of me.

01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:21.602
No, I'm not gonna let go...
Let go of me!

01:27:21.603 --> 01:27:23.170
I'm trying to help you.
Stop it.

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:24.672
But I can't. My daddy...

01:27:24.673 --> 01:27:26.774
We don't have a choice.
We don't have a choice.

01:27:26.775 --> 01:27:28.509
- Please, he's in trouble!
- No, no, no!

01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:31.178
Let me go! Let go of me!

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:32.680
Cass, it ain't none
of our business.

01:27:32.681 --> 01:27:34.081
No, let me go find my dad!

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:35.386
Let go of me!

01:27:36.685 --> 01:27:38.455
What the hell's going on here?

01:27:43.225 --> 01:27:44.759
You don't wanna get
into this, Cassie.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:45.961
Uh-uh.

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:26.901
Cassie.

01:28:26.902 --> 01:28:28.636
All right, Gator. Be cool, man.
All right? You're crazy.

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:29.837
Do you know that?
You're crazy.

01:28:29.838 --> 01:28:30.971
No, she's staying here!

01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:32.506
She's not!

01:28:32.507 --> 01:28:34.008
Cassie, you fucking
started this!

01:28:34.009 --> 01:28:35.810
I didn't ask for any of this!
Yeah, man!

01:28:35.811 --> 01:28:37.011
Just stay out of this!

01:28:37.012 --> 01:28:38.445
She's staying with me!
Let go of her!

01:28:38.446 --> 01:28:41.081
She is not staying with you! Cassie,
you stay the fuck out of this!

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:42.149
Let go of her!

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:43.250
Cassie, I'm warning you!

01:28:47.455 --> 01:28:48.963
Cassie?

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:50.491
Cassie!

01:28:50.492 --> 01:28:51.966
No!

01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:47.716
Stop the car.

01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:52.753
Dad! Dad! Dad!

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:54.521
Get down! Get down!
Please, stop!

01:29:54.522 --> 01:29:57.362
Get the fuck down! Do you
think I fucking wanted this?

01:29:57.893 --> 01:30:00.198
I just shot my fucking sister!

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:06.634
Dad!

01:30:29.557 --> 01:30:30.929
Just stop the car!

01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:36.030
Dispatch, tell the operator of the
intercoastal bridge, to open the bridge.

01:30:36.031 --> 01:30:37.403
Repeat. Open the bridge.

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:53.686
No! Fuck it!

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:22.786
God damn it.

01:31:22.811 --> 01:31:24.456
Close the bridge!
Close the bridge!

01:31:26.247 --> 01:31:29.350
Dad! Dad, you okay?

01:31:29.351 --> 01:31:30.818
No, stop please. Just...

01:31:30.819 --> 01:31:32.579
Nobody shoots, there's
a child on the bridge.

01:31:33.088 --> 01:31:35.189
Stop, please! Don't hurt him.

01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:37.458
Daddy! Stop!

01:31:37.459 --> 01:31:40.194
Dad, are you okay? Dad.

01:31:40.195 --> 01:31:41.862
Get back in the car, right now!

01:31:41.863 --> 01:31:44.131
I don't want you to see this!
Get in the fucking car!

01:31:44.132 --> 01:31:45.366
You don't have to do that!
Just stop it!

01:31:45.367 --> 01:31:46.467
Pop that trunk.
Please, just stop it!

01:31:46.468 --> 01:31:48.002
Get the fuck in the car!

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:49.770
Just leave him alone, please?
Get in the fucking car!

01:31:49.771 --> 01:31:51.472
Please! Daddy, I'm scared!

01:31:51.473 --> 01:31:54.051
Get in the car before I blow
your fucking brains out!

01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:56.245
God damn it.

01:32:13.995 --> 01:32:16.505
You smell the wood
burning, Bodine?

01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:20.612
You smell the fucking
wood burning?

01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:26.279
Now you connecting the dots?

01:32:28.143 --> 01:32:30.118
I'll teach you about reputation.

01:33:03.178 --> 01:33:04.721
She just saved your life.

01:33:56.164 --> 01:33:58.105
Let's go home, Maddy.

01:35:01.663 --> 01:35:04.070
<i>See you on the outside, Danny.</i>

01:35:06.968 --> 01:35:08.545
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>
